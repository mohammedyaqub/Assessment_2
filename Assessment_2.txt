1)  

 Concurrency :-
              It is the composition of independently executing process.
(process in the general sense, not linux processes. Famously hard to define.)
 Parallelism:-  
             Programming as the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computatons.
concurrency VS Parallelism:-
*Concurrency is dealing with lots of things at once.
*Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
Not the same , but related.
*Concurrency is about structure, Parallelism is about execution.
*Concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a problem that may(but not necessarly) be parallelizable.
*It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same instant.
   For example, multitasking on a single-core machine.
*Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time.
   For Example :- on a multicore processor.

*Go provides a mechanism called a channel. Go channel  is used to share data between goroutines.
*channel work with two principal operations one is sending and another one is receiving.
*If both the operations collectively known as communication. 
*And the direction of <- operator indicates whether the data is received or send. 
*In the channel, the send and receive operation block until another side is not ready by default.
send operation:- Mychannel <- element
Receive operation:- element := <-Mychannel

package main

import “fmt”

func myhello(ch chan bool) {
        fmt.Println(“My Hello world goroutine”)
        ch <- true 
}
func main() {
        ch1 := make(chan bool)
        go myhello(ch1)
        val := <-ch1
        fmt.Println(“in main function, Returned value is “, val)

}

4)
*The direction of <- channel  operator indicates whether the data is received values or send values . 
send operation:- Mychannel <- element
Receive operation:- element := <-Mychannel
Example:-
ch <- v    // Send v to channel ch.
v := <-ch  // Receive from ch, and
           // assign value to v.
(The data flows in the direction of the arrow.)

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {

    A1 := make(chan string, 1)
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        A1 <- "result 1"
    }()

    select {
    case res := <-A1:
        fmt.Println(res)
    case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
        fmt.Println("timeout 1")
    }
}

//another way of doing
func mysleep(x int) {
    //here x is int need to be type to pass after fun 
    // time.After return a channel will block untill the given time 
    <-time.After(time.Second * time.Duration(x))//blocks untill its received 
}

func main(){
    mysleep(5)//sleeping for the 5 seconds
}

*Channels is used to shared the data between goroutines.
*Two types of channels:-
                        Buffered channel and
                        UnBuffered channel
*A buffered channel is used for perform asynchronous communication.
*In buffered channel there is a capacity to hold one or more values before they're received.
buffered := make(chan int, 22)	// Buffered channel of integer type.

       channel name:=make(chan type,20)
